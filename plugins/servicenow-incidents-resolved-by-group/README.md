## Introduction

The **Look Up Incidents Resolved by My Assignment Group** plugin allows employees to retrieve a list of incidents resolved by a specific assignment group within a selected date range, directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. This provides instant visibility into team performance and workload trends—without the need to manually filter or run reports in ServiceNow.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

For this plugin, ensure the user has the following permissions:

- **Table Access**: `Read` access to the `sys_user`, `sys_user_group` and `incident` tables.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
